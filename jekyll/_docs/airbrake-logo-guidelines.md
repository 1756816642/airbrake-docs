---

We've had some trouble with people butchering our little logo so we decided to
put up the guidelines to help people work with it for promo posters and all that
jazz. Also, you can download our source files, yay, freebies!

**Please review the [Airbrake logo
guidelines](http://itolmach.github.io/logo-guidelines/index.html) before using
the Airbrake logo in your artworks** and to download the source files.

## Primary logo colours
**Our primary logo colours are white on orange and orange on white**. We're
not sure which one we like better, but chances are, your background will be
white rather than a particular colour of orange we use, so let's go with orange
logo on white background being our informed decision favourite. Our heart is
undecided.

## Only use orange logo with a white background
**Don't use our orange logo on any background other than white** (we're
hesitant about white on black version, but we'll let it slide this time). If you
must â€“ put up an underlaying white rectangle in between. If that's not possible,
please use our white logo version but **make sure that the "A" in the
icon on the left is the same colour as your background**. We can't stress it
enough.

## Using a part of the logo
**You can use parts of our logo separately** (icon or just the text). If you
can, use the full version, if you can't decide which part to use we rank them as
follows: full, text only, icon only.

## Don't alter the logo
Those source files are there for a reason and we trust you enough to give them
to you cause we know you want mess with them.  We're worried about those bad
dudes who will.

## Questions?
Do contact us if there's anything unclear with the guidelines, our creative
team is super cool, you'll see!

The Airbrake logo, names and Airbrakeman character are all trademarks, so using
those for things that don't have anything to do with Airbrake is not cool. We'll
be super upset :(
