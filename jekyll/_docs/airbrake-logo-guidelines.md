We've had some trouble with people butchering our little logo so we decided to
put up the guidelines to help people work with it for promo posters and all that
jazz. Also, you can download our source files, yay, freebies!

## Primary logo
This is the primary Airbrake.io logo to be used in the majority of marketing and
promotional cases.

### Colors used
- Orange (#f58c54)
- White (#fff)

### Typeface used
- Typeface used for ”A” in the icon is Museo 700
- Typeface used for “Airbrake.io” logotype is Museo 300

## Only use orange logo with a white background
**Don't use our orange logo on any background other than white**. If you
must – put up an underlaying white rectangle in between. If that's not possible,
please use our white logo version but **make sure that the "A" in the
icon on the left is the same colour as your background**. We can't stress it
enough.

## Isotype
Isotype can be used when there's not enough space to fit the primary logo and
shrinking it down results in unreadable text. If there's not enough horizontal
space, see vertical logo lockup.

## Vertical logo
Sometimes a vertical composition is required but space allows for both isotype
and logotype to be used. In this case it's advised to use the vertical logo lockup.

## Don't alter the logo
Those source files are there for a reason and we trust you enough to give them
to you cause we know you won't mess with them. We're worried about those bad dudes
who will.

## Questions?
Do contact us if there's anything unclear with the guidelines, our creative
team is super cool, you'll see!

The Airbrake logo, names and Airbrakeman character are all trademarks, so using
those for things that don't have anything to do with Airbrake is not cool. We'll
be super upset.
