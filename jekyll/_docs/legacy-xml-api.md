description: deprecated notifier API v23
---

### **NOTE:** this API is **DEPRECATED** and has been replaced by the [V3 Notifier API](https://airbrake.io/docs/api/#create-notice-v3).

Airbrake accepts error notifications via a RESTful XML API. Clients send XML
data to Airbrake using an HTTP `POST` to
`http://api.airbrake.io/notifier_api/v2/notices`.

If you're looking to read your existing data from Airbrake and not send new
data, you'll want to read up on the [Data API](/docs/api/).

### iOS notifier
If you are using the iOS notifier make sure you are using the most current
version available.

* Pull the latest code from GitHub
* Push a new version of your application to the App Store
* If using [App version](/docs/features/app-versions) to ignore
errors from previous versions, update the **Min app version** field of your
Airbrake project settings.

### Content Type

All error notification requests should set a content type of "text/xml." Other
content types will not be processed.

### Schema

Airbrake validates incoming XML using an XSD schema, available at
http://airbrake.io/airbrake_2_3.xsd. When writing a notifier client, we
recommend [**Validating XML**](http://www.xmlforasp.net/schemavalidator.aspx)
in unit tests using the [**XSD schema**](http://airbrake.io/airbrake_2_3.xsd).

### Incoming Errors

Incoming errors should be described using XML in the POST body of the HTTP
request. The available elements are described below. The elements are listed as
xpath, so /notice/api-key means an api-key element underneath a notice element,
and /notice/@version means the version attribute of the notice element.

`notice/@version`

Required. The version of the API being used. Should be set to "2.3"

`/notice/api-key`

Required. The API key for the project that this error belongs to. The API key
can be found by viewing the edit project form on the Airbrake site.

`/notice/notifier/name`

Required. The name of the notifier client submitting the request, such as
"hoptoad4j" or "rack-hoptoad."

`/notice/notifier/version`

Required. The version number of the notifier client submitting the request.

`/notice/notifier/url`

Required. A URL at which more information can be obtained concerning the
notifier client.

`/notice/error/class`

Required. The class name or type of error that occurred.

`/notice/error/message`

Optional. A short message describing the error that occurred.

`/notice/error/backtrace/line`

Required. This element can occur more than once. Each line element describes
one code location or frame in the backtrace when the error occurred, and
requires @file and @number attributes. If the location includes a method or
function, the @method attribute should be used.

`/notice/request`

Optional. If this error occurred during an HTTP request, the children of this
element can be used to describe the request that caused the error.

`/notice/request/url`

Required only if there is a request element. The URL at which the error
occurred.

`/notice/request/component`

Required only if there is a request element. The component in which the error
occurred. In model-view-controller frameworks like Rails, this should be set to
the controller. Otherwise, this can be set to a route or other request
category.

`/notice/request/action`

Optional. The action in which the error occurred. If each request is routed to
a controller action, this should be set here. Otherwise, this can be set to a
method or other request subcategory.

`/notice/request/params/var`

Optional. A list of var elements describing request parameters from the query
string, POST body, routing, and other inputs. See the section on var elements
below.

`/notice/request/session/var`

Optional. A list of var elements describing session variables from the request.
See the section on var elements below.

`/notice/request/cgi-data/var`

Optional. A list of var elements describing CGI variables from the request,
such as SERVER_NAME and REQUEST_URI. See the section on var elements below.

`/notice/server-environment/project-root`

Optional. The path to the project in which the error occurred, such as
RAILS_ROOT or DOCUMENT_ROOT.

`/notice/server-environment/environment-name`

Required. The name of the server environment in which the error occurred, such
as "staging" or "production."

`/notice/server-environment/app-version`

Optional. The version of the application that this error came from. If the App
Version is set on the project, then errors older than the project's app version
will be ignored. This version field uses
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) style versioning.

`//var elements`

The params, session, and cgi-data elements can contain one or more var elements
for each parameter or variable that was set when the error occurred. Each var
element should have a @key attribute for the name of the variable, and element
text content for the value of the variable.

### Success responses

The server will respond with a 200 OK response if the error is accepted. The
response body will contain a notice

### Failure Responses

If Airbrake cannot create a notice, it will respond with a failure code and
message. There are several possible failure responses:

 * 403 - the requested project does not support SSL - resubmit in an http request
 * 422 - the submitted notice was invalid - check the notice xml against the
   schema and ensure the API key is correct
 * 500 - unexpected errors - submit a bug report at http://help.airbrake.io

The response body for a failure will contain XML describing the error. The XML
will have an errors root element with one or more error children, describing
each error that occurred.

### Tracking deploys

When Airbrake receives a deploy notification, it will automatically set all
errors on that environment to resolved. When new errors come in that get
grouped with previously resolved errors, Airbrake will notify you via email and
unresolve the entire group again.

If your plan supports deploy tracking, you can `POST` to
`http://api.airbrake.io/deploys.txt`

The parameters supported are:

* `api_key` (required)
* `deploy[rails_env]`: (required). Which environment was just deployed to. For
  example, staging or production.
* `deploy[scm_repository]`: What's your version control repo's address.
* `deploy[scm_revision]`: What's the version control revision.
* `deploy[local_username]`: Who deployed?

The last three parameters are just used for displaying in the deploy history view.

### Restrictions

For storage and performance reasons, Airbrake limits the size of incoming
exceptions. The following restrictions are currently in place:

 * Error messages, files, components, actions, environment names, request URLs,
   and error class names are truncated after 255 characters.
 * Any incoming element with text content over 2 kilobytes will be truncated.
 * Only the first 2000 var elements will be accepted in notice XML. The rest
   will be discarded.
