**As a general policy, we will not cancel your account for you. We want to make
sure that requests to cancel accounts are legitimate.**

### How to cancel your Airbrake account

![cancel-account.png](/docs/assets/img/docs/airbrake/cancel_account.png)

To cancel an account, have an administrator on your account go to the *Account
& billing* page and cancel your account by clicking the "Cancel Account" button.
This section can be found under **your user name in the upper right corner** ->
**Account & billing** or at this URL:

### Having trouble?
If you have a situation where the admin has left your company or otherwise
cannot cancel an account, let us know and we'll attempt to help.  In this
situation, we will attempt to get some confirmation that we're speaking to the
right company beforehand. **We won't just cancel an account based on one
request in the help section**.
