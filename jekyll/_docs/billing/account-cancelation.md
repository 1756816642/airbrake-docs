**As a general policy, we will not cancel your account for you. We want to make
sure that requests to cancel accounts are legitimate.**

### How to cancel your Airbrake account
To cancel an account, have an administrator on your account go to the *Account
Settings* page and cancel your account by clicking the "Cancel Account" button.
This section can be found at **Settings** -> **Account Settings** or at this URL:
`https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.airbrake.io/account/edit` where you put your real
Airbrake subdomain instead of `YOURSUBDOMAIN`

### Having trouble?  If you have a situation where the admin has left your
company or otherwise cannot cancel an account, let us know and we'll attempt to
help.  In this situation, we will attempt to get some confirmation that we're
speaking to the right company beforehand. **We won't just cancel an account based
on one request in the help section**.
