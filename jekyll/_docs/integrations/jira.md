Tired of wasting your limited time scraping together the context and
details needed to create useful JIRA issues? By the end of this doc Airbrake
will be automatically creating them for you!

When your Airbrake project receives a new error a corresponding
[JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview) issue is created.
JIRA issues created by Airbrake let you get to work quickly on
problems effecting your users, giving you everything you need to solve problems
fast!

This integration supports **onDemand** and **Standalone** versions of JIRA.

## Configuring the JIRA integration

1. Click **Integrations** for your project
2. Click **JIRA**

Atlassian account. **Standalone** means you setup JIRA yourself or with a 3rd
party.

**Please ensure this user you provide has proper permissions to the Project.**
