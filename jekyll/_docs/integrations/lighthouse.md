Airbrake can integrate with your existing
[Lighthouse](https://lighthouseapp.com) account, allowing you to create
Lighthouse tickets for new Airbrake errors.

Configuration involves 2 steps. The first step involves creating a Lighthouse
API token on the Lighthouse site. The second is to configure Airbrake to use
your Lighthouse **API token**, **subdomain**, and **project id**.

## Lighthouse API token creation

You can create a Lighthouse token on your Lighthouse account's user profile
page. Be sure to give **full access** to the token as shown below.

Once you've successfully created the token, you'll see it listed in that same
area (see image below). Take note of the token value for the next steps.

## Airbrake Account and Project Configuration

To setup the and make use of the information in your lighthouse URL:

![subdomain and project id](/docs/assets/img/docs/integrations/lighthouse_subdomain_and_project_id.png)

Click on **Integrations** and then on **Lighthouse** to fill in your Lighthouse
information. First, fill in the Lighthouse access token:

After that, fill in the Lighthouse subdomain and the Lighthouse project ID:
