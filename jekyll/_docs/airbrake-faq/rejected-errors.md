> Note: Rejected errors are different from [error loss due to surpassing your
rate limit](/docs/airbrake-faq/what-is-a-rate-limit).

## Invalid format
The error notice is rejected if it is sent with incorrect JSON/XML as determined
by:

- **JSON:** [POST data schema](https://airbrake.io/docs/api/#post-data-schema-v3) and
[POST data fields](https:/airbrake.io/docs/api/#post-data-fields-v3)
- **XML**: as described in our [XML API doc](/docs/api-2/notifier-api-v23)

## Rejections in the dashboard

### Graphed rejections
You can view rejected error trends in your project overview graph.

### Placeholder exceptions`AirbrakeNotice`
Rejections are also displayed in your error groups list and appear as
`AirbrakeNotice` placeholder exceptions that provide as much information as
possible. These placeholders let you know that your Airbrake notifier library
couldn't parse an error into the correct format.

## Getting rejections?

### Experimental Airbrake notifier
It's common to see error rejections when using an experimental or unsupported
Airbrake notifiers. You can use the information provided by the `AirbrakeNotice`
placeholder to troubleshoot your notifier. `AirbrakeNotice` placeholders can be a
valuable debugging asset when developing a new Airbrake Notifier and reporting
GitHub issues.

### Official Airbrake notifier
Rejections are less likely with official and widely adopted Airbrake notifiers.
However, if errors sent by your Notifier are consistently getting rejected,
please help improve the Airbrake notifier you are using by creating a GitHub
issue for the notifier and reporting the problem to support@airbrake.io.
