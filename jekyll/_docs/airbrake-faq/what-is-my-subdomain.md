### What's a subdomain?
Each Airbrake account has a unique subdomain.  The subdomain is present in all Airbrake URLs when a user is logged in.

### Where can I find my subdomain?
You can find your subdomain in any Airbrake URL after you're signed in or in the **Account & Billing** section of the settings page.
