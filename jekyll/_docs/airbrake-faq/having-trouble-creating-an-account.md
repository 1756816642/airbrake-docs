This document outlines the simple setups creating your Airbrake account. We
hope it will help you get your account created quickly and easily.

## Choosing a subdomain

This is going to be a unique URL for your team to log into Airbrake, it can't
be the URL of your site and has to be one word.

For example, If I ran a business with a range of apps for Cats. I wouldn't put
`snapcat.com` instead I simply put `snapcat`.  The subdomain you choose
prefixes the Airbrake domain like `snapcat.airbrake.io`, so your airbrake
accounts can be accessed individually if you have more than one.

## Accepted credit cards
We accept visa, mastercard, american express and discover, We use Stripe for
credit card processing.

## No credit card required
If you would like to Try Airbrake without using a credit card you can get
started with our [one developer & one project
plan](https://airbrake.io/account/new/free).

This plan is excellent for learning the Airbrake UI and integrating Airbrake
into your application. However, the low limits on this free plan make it
unsuitable for error monitoring in production applications.
