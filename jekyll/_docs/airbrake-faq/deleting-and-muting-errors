description: how to delete and mute errors
---
Errors can be deleted or muted through the Airbrake UI. In each error overview
you'll see buttons you can use to either delete the error or mute the error.
- Deleting an error will permantly remove it. If you recieve a new occurrence 
of a deleted error, it will create a new error group and you will be notified.
- Muting an error will prevent notifcations from being received for that error
but the error will be visible on your dashboard and marked as muted. Muted
errors can be unmuted.
