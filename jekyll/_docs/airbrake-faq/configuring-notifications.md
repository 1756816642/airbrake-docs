## What settings are available per project?

### **Notify on error**
You will be notified whenever a new exception group is created or an error
group becomes unresolved.

### **Notify on comments**
You will be notified when another team member comments on an exception

### **Production environment only**
Only receive notifications from errors that occur in the `production`
environment.

### Notes

- These settings are user specific.
- These settings only affect email notifications. They will not affect your
  Slack or Hipchat integrations as those are setup per project.*
- The environment needs to be `production` (case independent). eg: `Production` 
  is a production environment while `production_US` and `prod` are not a 
  production environments.
