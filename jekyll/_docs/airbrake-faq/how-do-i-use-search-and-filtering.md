Search and filtering are available in one easy-to-use search box. Switch between "Resolved" and "Unresolved" errors, search, and filter all in one place.

## Search Input

## Filtering by Custom Attributes

To filter by additional attributes not present in the standard options, first visit the "Aggregations" tab for one of your errors. Next, select an attribute from the "Custom aggregations" dropdown. Finally, click the "Pin aggregation for all errors & project search" button to enable search capabilities on this attribute.

Custom filtering is available on the [Business plan and above](https://airbrake.io/account/plan/edit).

After the custom aggregation has been processed, you will be able to filter errors based on this attribute.
