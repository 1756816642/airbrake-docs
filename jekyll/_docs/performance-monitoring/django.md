## Django Support

**Django support for Performance Monitoring is currently in early access**

The `pybrake` package makes it quick and easy to monitor your Django app's
performance. It only takes a few minutes to start collecting real performance
data so let's jump right in!

{% include django-install.md %}

## Congratulations!

Great job! Just visit your Airbrake project's Performance Dashboard to see route
data for your app. Soon enough you'll have more insights into your application's
performance. In the meantime why not check out the [Performance Dashboard
features](/docs/performance-monitoring/performance-dashboard-features/). If you
have questions about Performance Monitoring, visit the [Performance Monitoring
FAQ](/docs/performance-monitoring/frequently-asked-questions/).
