Application Performance Monitoring with Airbrake makes it easy to:
- See a broad performance overview for your whole application
- Measure user satisfaction with your app performance using Apdex
- Identify routes with problematic performance
- Zoom into specific endpoints to see time spent in the DB, view, cache,
  external requests, and more

## Flask Support

**Flask support for Performance Monitoring is currently in early access**

The `pybrake` package makes it quick and easy to monitor your Flask app's
performance. It only takes a few minutes to start collecting real performance
data so let's jump right in!

{% include flask-install.md %}

## Congratulations!

Great job! Just visit your Airbrake project's Performance Dashboard to see route
data for your app. Soon enough you'll have more insights into your application's
performance. In the meantime why not check out the [Performance Dashboard
features](/docs/performance-monitoring/performance-dashboard-features/). If you
have questions about Performance Monitoring, visit the [Performance Monitoring
FAQ](/docs/performance-monitoring/frequently-asked-questions/).
