### Airbrake V5

Airbrake V5 populates your `airbrake.rb` file with some useful config options
with descriptions in commented out blocks. You can find configuration options
in the [Configuration section of the
README](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/blob/master/README.md#configuration).


The [V4 to V5 migration
guide](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/blob/master/docs/Migration_guide_from_v4_to_v5.md)
Also has some excellent configuration examples.
