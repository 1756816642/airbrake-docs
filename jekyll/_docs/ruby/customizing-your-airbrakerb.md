### Airbrake V5

Airbrake V5 populates your `airbrake.rb` file with some useful config options
with descriptions in commented out blocks. You can find configuration options
in the [Configuration section of the
README](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/blob/master/README.md#configuration).


The [V4 to V5 migration
guide](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/blob/master/docs/Migration_guide_from_v4_to_v5.md)
Also has some excellent configuration examples.

### (DEPRECATED) Airbrake V4

Airbrake V4 is deprecated and we highly recommend [migrating to Airbrake
V5](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/blob/master/docs/Migration_guide_from_v4_to_v5.md)
to get the most out of the Airbrake service and features.

If migrating to the new V5 Airbrake gem is not possible you can use our
[customize Airbrake V4
airbrake.rb](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/wiki/Customizing-your-airbrake.rb)
doc to customize your `airbrake.rb`.

There are some common config options and notifier use cases in the [Airbrake V4
wiki](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/wiki).
